I interested to implement ERC721x (https://erc721x.org/) for this project, but due to OpenZeppelin contracts has more clearer code, I decided to go with OpenZeppelin's implementation with OpenZeppelin SDK upgradable pattern to open the possibility to use ERC721x in the future.

There are two possible algorithm for `makingChange` (Greedy and Dynamic Programming), I decided to use these algorithms to demonstrate OpenZeppelin SDK upgradable pattern. And this upgradable pattern heavily utilize inheritance behaviour in Solidity, thus the project is implemented in Solidity language rather than Vyper or LLL.

The function `makingChange` is an internal function, first consideration is to use `view` function for it. But, after I checked the gas cost for a contract to call view function and normal function is the same, I decided to use normal function instead so it can enable gas optimization for Dynamic Programming approach.
